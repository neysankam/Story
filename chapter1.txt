1) cd <FolderName>: 'Create Directory' navigates to <FolderName> (this is the working directory)
2) mkdir <name>: 'make directory' creates a folder in cd, named <name>
3) ls: shows contents of the folder you are in (e.g. cd <FolderName>)
4) touch <FileName.type>: Creates a file in the cd (e.g. chapter1.txt)
5) open <FileName.type>: navigates into the desired folder (will open in default app -> 'vim' in console will open a console based text editor instead of default app)

*make edits in app, and then save*

6) git init: initializes empty git repository inside the <FolderName> directory
7) ls -a: will show hidden files in the folder, where git versions will be saved
8) git status: Shows the files in working directory, and not yet in staging area (these are dynamic untracked files being worked on, shown in red)
9) git add <FileName.type>: adds the file to staging area, and begins tracking changes (will now show green in 'git status')
	9*) git add . : the '.' will add all the files in the working directory folder to the staging area (use 'git 
	status' again to check if the files got added to staging area (i.e. turned green))
10) git commit -m "<description>": creates a save point with <description> message ('-m') (explain the changes made since last save point)

11) git log: shows what Commits have been made (commit hash, author, and date shown for each Commit save point)
